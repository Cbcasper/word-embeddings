# Svelte + Vite + Tailwind

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Install

Only [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) is required to run this webapp.

## Build and Run

First run `npm install` in the top level directory. This will install all the modules needed to run the webapp in the local folder `node_modules`. **Do not add this to git.** It is already added to the `.gitignore`.

With all packages installed, you can run the app with `npm run dev`. This will start the dev server with live reloads. Click the link to localhost to open in the browser.
